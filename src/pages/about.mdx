# About

Hello, I'm Bruno, a software engineer working remotely from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I'm married with a psychologist.

This site and the blog is using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), with tailwind css, some pages
and blog posts written using mdx.

You can see some of my open source contributions on my [Github](https://github.com/brunoarueira).
