# blog

This is the repository for my site and blog where I write some random thoughts
about software development and related things.

## Stack

This project is made with:

- Astrojs;
- TailwindCSS;
- MDX

## Development

To enhance or fix something. First, you'll need to clone this repository:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/brunoarueira/blog.git
```

After, run the commands below:

```sh
  cd blog/
  yarn install
```

Open your editor of choice and start to improve or fix what you want.

To see the changes, you'll need to run:

```sh
  yarn dev
```

The command above will start the Astro development server, typically running on port `4321`.
Open on your browser to `http://localhost:4321` and you'll see your recent changes.
