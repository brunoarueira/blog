# blog

This is the repository for my site and blog where I write some random thoughts
about software development and related things.

## Stack

I like a lot to use gatsby and this projects is entirely made with it, alongside
with tailwindcss, mdx (to write markdown posts/pages with some nice embedded react
components), styled-components and some custom react components.

## Development

To enhance or fix something. First, you'll need to clone this repository:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/brunoarueira/blog.git
```

After, run the commands below:

```sh
  cd blog/
  yarn install
```

Open your editor of choice and start to improve or fix which you want.

To see the changes, you'll need to run:

```sh
  yarn dev
```

The command above will start the `gatsby server` to run on `8081` port, then
open on your browser `http://localhost:8081` and you'll see your recent
changes.
