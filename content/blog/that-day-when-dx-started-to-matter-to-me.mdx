The day when developer experience (DX) starts matter to me was when I'd to make a meeting to support a developer from 
another company integrate with my employer.

## But, why after that and not before?

Because I never thought DX was thing, probably because I've been always a "hacker" and when in front of issues, I'll dig
down and persist to resolve.

I know many developers out there, like to have someone guiding and offer support to deliver something, but I didn't know
the term exists.

## The process

The meeting initially was to help debug issues using our internal tools or understanding if there is a bug with our codebase, 
which in this case was the last option since the API was exaustly tested, but who knows.

After the meeting started, I'd to ask for the language was used to integrate (they're using python), what is the endpoint and
open our tools (e.g. logging monitoring and exception tracker).

Catch some data after some steps with other endpoints and only one endpoint was misbehaving, with that I open the codebase and
tried to dig through the code to find some issue or insights about the problem.

I'd found nothing, look at our unit tests and nothing suggests error from our side, then I'd ask to show a code snippet how the
developer was calling our API. Since I known a little about python, I'd to start search through the internet, therefore found the
issue was with the way the developer is creating the JSON payload to send. Example below:

```diff
import requests

-payload = "{ 'foo': { 'url': 'http://something.lvh.me' } }"
+payload = { 'foo': { 'url': 'http://something.lvh.me' } }

r = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:9292',
    verify = False,
    json = payload
)

print(r.status_code)
print(r.headers)
```

Note the difference? The way the developer was sending the payload is a string and when our API receives it, was ignoring and doesn't
behaving accordingly. I don't judge the way to write that code, because in the past, I'd write many times something similar, but sometimes
many of us struggle to find the problem.

After the call I'd thinking about it, commented with my CTO and he said "Welcome to devx".

## Lesson learned

Most of the time we'd to care about the developer on the other end, probably writing some code snippets or some guides, besides the API
documentation, which in some isn't enough as this case was.
