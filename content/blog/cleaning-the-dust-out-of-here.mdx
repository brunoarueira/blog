I've been away from here, for some time. My last post was in August 7, 2020
(you can check [here](/blog/using-more-from-database-instead-of-sidekiq-workers)),
but the reason was I've left my last job (Software Developer at
[Atos6](https://www.atos6.com)) and got a new one as Software Developer at
[Grafeno Digital](https://www.grafeno.digital).

At my last job I've learned countless things, including the startup pace. Some of
the things I've learned is:

- React;
- Decoupled frontends;
- Increase performance of CSV export;
- Optimization of queries;
- Automate whitelabel apps built in React Native through fastlane inside a CI;
- A bit of DevOps;
- GraphQL;
- More about REST APIs;
- Scale up applications;
- Among other things;

About the learned things I want to write about on the next couple months.
I've acquired a good knowledge, understanding the needs from a customer,
maintenance of a large legacy codebase, designing the path to decouple
some parts and converting into microservices.

Many posts should arrive here about the frustrations, refactorings, fails and
victories I've gotten there.

This movement was one from many out there to left the comfort zone, find new
challenges and improve themselves. For me, it's the same, as feel more natural
as software developer to challenge the knowledge acquired and pursuit new jobs,
new mentalities, to improve or apply the things which I've learned before.

I'm so grateful to every piece of knowledge and mainly to all devs which
I work with and help, shared or absorb some form of knowledge.

My sincere thanks to you all ;)
